# Intelligent Question Selection System

## Overview

The Intelligent Question Selection system is a comprehensive solution that provides 80-90% reduction in AI API calls while maintaining high-quality, diverse question sets. It uses role analysis, diversity algorithms, and intelligent scoring to select the best questions from the database, with AI generation as a fallback.

```

## Key Components

### 1. Role Analysis Service (`app/services/role_analysis_service.py`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes job descriptions and roles to extract key characteristics.

**Features**:
- Skill extraction from job descriptions
- Industry detection
- Seniority level identification
- Company size analysis
- Technology stack extraction
- Soft skills identification

**Example Usage**:
```python
from app.services.role_analysis_service import RoleAnalysisService

service = RoleAnalysisService()
analysis = await service.analyze_role("Software Engineer", job_description)
print(f"Industry: {analysis.industry.value}")
print(f"Skills: {analysis.required_skills}")
```

### 2. Question Diversity Engine (`app/services/question_diversity_engine.py`)

**Purpose**: Ensures balanced and diverse question sets across categories and difficulties.

**Features**:
- Category balancing (technical, behavioral, system design, leadership)
- Difficulty distribution (easy, medium, hard)
- Tag diversity optimization
- User history consideration
- Configurable diversity parameters

**Example Usage**:
```python
from app.services.question_diversity_engine import QuestionDiversityEngine

engine = QuestionDiversityEngine()
diverse_questions = await engine.ensure_diversity(
    questions, 
    target_count=10, 
    role_type="senior"
)
```

### 3. Intelligent Question Selector (`app/services/intelligent_question_selector.py`)

**Purpose**: Core logic for selecting the best questions based on role analysis and user context.

**Features**:
- Database-first approach
- Question scoring and ranking
- User personalization
- AI fallback integration
- Performance metrics tracking

**Example Usage**:
```python
from app.services.intelligent_question_selector import IntelligentQuestionSelector, UserContext

selector = IntelligentQuestionSelector(db_session)
user_context = UserContext(
    user_id="user123",
    previous_questions=["q1", "q2"],
    weak_areas=["algorithms"]
)

result = await selector.select_questions(
    role="Software Engineer",
    job_description=jd,
    user_context=user_context,
    target_count=10
)
```

### 4. AI Fallback Service (`app/services/ai_fallback_service.py`)

**Purpose**: Generates questions when database has insufficient variety.

**Features**:
- Targeted question generation for missing types
- Integration with multiple AI services
- Automatic question storage
- Quality scoring
- Performance tracking

**Example Usage**:
```python
from app.services.ai_fallback_service import AIFallbackService, QuestionGenerationRequest

service = AIFallbackService(db_session)
request = QuestionGenerationRequest(
    role_analysis=analysis,
    missing_categories=["system_design"],
    target_count=3
)

result = await service.generate_missing_questions(request)
```
