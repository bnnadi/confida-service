# Inspect Routes

## Trigger
Command: `/apiroutes`

## Description
When triggered, I will:
- Inspect the backend routes (Express, Fastify, Nest, etc.).
- Generate a structured list of available endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Show their file locations and expected request/response parameters if typed.
- Highlight any untested or undocumented endpoints.
